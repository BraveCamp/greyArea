                <h4>Do you know what implicit bias is? Also known as implicit social cognition, <b><i>implicit bias</i></b> refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. They are activated involuntarily and without an individual’s awareness or intentional control. This is why many times, we are not aware that a thought we had or action we took is racist. </h4>

                <h1>White Privilege and What To Do With It</h1>
                <h4>Now that you know all of us are a little biased, let's talk about white privilege. <b> <i> White privilege </i></b> is taking it for granted that when you’re shopping alone, you probably won’t be followed or harassed. Or knowing that if you ask to speak to “the person in charge,” you’ll almost certainly be facing someone of your own race. Being able to think about different social, political or professional options without asking whether someone of your race would be accepted or allowed to do what you want to do. White privilege is when white people get away with doing things that people of color don't. White privilege is also hard to recognize. Does that mean that if you're white, you don't have problems? No, it just means <i> race is not one of them. </i> </h4>

                    <h1> Colorism <h1>
                        <h4> Now that you've taken the tests, you have learned that people of color can also be biased. Do you know what colorism is? <b><i>Colorism</i> </b> disadvantages dark-skinned people while privileging those with lighter skin. For instance, black women with a lighter skin tone are seen as more beautiful than black women with a darker skin. When fighting racism, we need to acknowledge that colorism is also an issue.
